  Hi! I'm Sayan Giri, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science undergraduate
  currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Computer Science (4-year
  program) at Midnapore College (Autonomous). With a strong interest in
  technology and creative problem-solving, I’m particularly drawn to the world
  of web development. I have hands-on experience in programming languages like
  Python, Java, and Shell scripting, and I’m actively building my skills in
  front-end and back-end web technologies to become a full-fledged Web
  Developer. My goal is to create impactful, user-friendly digital experiences
  while continuously learning and growing in this dynamic field.
